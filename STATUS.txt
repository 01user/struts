MIGRATING FROM ACTION 1 TO ACTION 2 

An area on the wiki is devoted to migrating from Action 1 to Action 2 

* http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsAction2

There is an Apps area in the sandbox for new Action2 code, starting with 
example applications.

* https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/sandbox/trunk/action2/

** The MailReader application has been ported. Comments and fixes 
welcome.

** A new Cookbook application has been started. The suggestion is 
that we combine the WW Showcase examples and the various Struts 
Examples into a unified cookbook. The cookbook application can 
display the code used to create the "recipes", like the Tomcat 
Example application.

** The design of the cookbook makes it easy to add new recipes. 
Please feel free to jump in and contribute!

PACKAGE NAMING

* org.opensyphony -> org.apache.struts
* webwork -> action2

* tag prefix: saf
* property and configuration files: action


* xwork.xml -> struts-action.xml

--

* The Dojo component package was previously 'webwork'.  
** It is temporarily renamed it to 'struts', but that might conflict 
   with Shale if they create new Dojo components.
*** Or perhaps that might be a good thing?

<< Ted: I'd say rename this component to "action". Apache Struts is 
   the *project* name, like "Open Symphony", not the *product* name, 
   like XWork or Sitemesh. If we name anything new "Struts", 
   it should be because it's something that is being used by multiple 
   Apache Struts products.

WORKING ACTION2 BUILD 

* The WebWork2 Incubator code now builds struts-action-2.0-dev.jar

** This JAR can be placed into your sandboxes for runtime testing

* The initial renaming is complete,and the repository seems stable 
enough to make further changes.  

* The WebWork 2 project had a continuous integration server for automated
builds and testing.It would be valuable to have that service, even while 
in the Incubator. 

** What about setting up a temporary build server either in an 
Apache zone or on a developer's computer?

----

CONFLUENCE MIGRATION

What do we need to do to register the Snippet macro the ASF SVN?

* http://forums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?threadID=24290&tstart=0

WebWork2 wiki is now readonly. Volunteers may migrate and add content 
to <http://confluence.twdata.org> at will. Eventually, this content 
may be transferred directly to a ASF server. 

----

JIRA MILESTONES

We prefixING the old releases with WW and startING the new releases
with a numbering scheme only. In this way, old releases will be 
archived properly and we do not lose the history.

----

EARLY RELEASE 

Don and Jason will be hosting a Struts session at JavaOne on May 17. 
It would be helpful if a tagged build of Action2 were available, 
even if Action2 is not out of the incubator yet (though it may be).

Here are some of the things we need to do to create a tagged build:

 1. The tickets gone through, keeping only essential tickets against this next release (2.0.0)
 2. Ensuring the project renaming is complete in a files, including source code comments
 3. Renaming WW instances on the wiki docs (once we get something stood up)
 4. Testing some of the new changes like the date picker, rich text editor, and tooltips

The general release process is described here:

* http://struts.apache.org/releases.html
