MIGRATING FROM ACTION 1 TO ACTION 2 

An area on the wiki is devoted to migrating from Action 1 to Action 2 

* http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsAction2

There is an Apps area in the sandbox for new Action2 code, starting with 
example applications.

* https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/sandbox/trunk/action2/

** The MailReader application has been ported. Comments and fixes 
welcome. The "Tour" is next.

** A new Cookbook application has been started. The suggestion is 
that we combine the WW Showcase examples and the various Struts 
Examples into a unified cookbook. The cookbook application can 
display the code used to create the "recipes", like the Tomcat 
Example application.

** The design of the cookbook makes it easy to add new recipes. 
Please feel free to jump in and contribute!

WORKING ACTION2 BUILD 

* The WebWork2 Incubator code now builds struts-action-2.0-dev.jar

** This JAR can be placed into your sandboxes for runtime testing

* The initial renaming is complete,and the repository seems stable 
enough to make further changes.  

* The WebWork 2 project had a continuous integration server for automated
builds and testing.It would be valuable to have that service, even while 
in the Incubator. 

** What about setting up a temporary build server either in an 
Apache zone or on a developer's computer?
