BOARD STATUS REPORTS 

[18 Apr 2006] 

The last quarter has seen the creation of the WebWork 2 podling and rapid progress.  Our focus has been on migrating
code, resources, developers, IP, and community over to the ASF.

 - Code: we have imported the code into the Incubator SVN, and have renamed packages, taglib prefixes, and any other
references to the old WebWork project over to the new Struts Action Framework 2 project, where the final location of the
code will be.

 - Resources: We've migrated the code to the Apache SVN, setup and migrated JIRA tickets to the new issues.apache.org
server, and are in the process of migration wiki documentation.

 - Developers: The core WebWork 2 developers have been given accounts and access to the podling, voted in through the
proposal.  We plan to vote the remaining committers in one-by-one through the Struts PMC, serving as the IPMC for the
podling.

 - IP: The OpenSymphony organization, who owns the copyright on the WebWork 2 project, has delivered a code grant
allowing us to change the copyright.  Additionally, we've removed most of the LGPL source code (usually in the form of
Javascript libraries) and have developed an optional build that compiles integration code depending on LGPL jars, in
accordance to the draft IP policy document.

 - Community: The WebWork 2 developers have joined the Struts mailing lists and have been very active in participating
with both development and user threads.  They have been just as, if not more, active committing to the code repository
as Struts committers, and when conflicts arise, they are very quick to come to a solution in a positive way.  In
addition, several Struts committers have joined OpenSymphony forums, chat rooms, and projects further strengthening the
relationship.

We are definitely planning on exiting the Incubator this next quarter, possibly within weeks.  We see a bright future
for the Struts Action project, and hope to facilitate a new spirit of cooperation within the competitive landscape of
Java web application frameworks

MIGRATING FROM ACTION 1 TO ACTION 2 

An area on the wiki is devoted to migrating from Action 1 to Action 2 

* http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsAction2

There is an Apps area in the sandbox for new Action2 code, starting with 
example applications.

* https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/sandbox/trunk/action2/

** The MailReader application has been ported. Comments and fixes 
welcome.

** A new Cookbook application has been started. The suggestion is 
that we combine the WW Showcase examples and the various Struts 
Examples into a unified cookbook. The cookbook application can 
display the code used to create the "recipes", like the Tomcat 
Example application.

** The design of the cookbook makes it easy to add new recipes. 
Please feel free to jump in and contribute!

PACKAGE NAMING

* org.opensyphony -> org.apache.struts
* webwork -> action2

* tag prefix: saf
* property and configuration files: action


* xwork.xml -> struts-action.xml

--

* The Dojo component package was previously 'webwork'.  
** It is temporarily renamed it to 'struts', but that might conflict 
   with Shale if they create new Dojo components.
*** Or perhaps that might be a good thing?

<< Ted: I'd say rename this component to "action". Apache Struts is 
   the *project* name, like "Open Symphony", not the *product* name, 
   like XWork or Sitemesh. If we name anything new "Struts", 
   it should be because it's something that is being used by multiple 
   Apache Struts products.

WORKING ACTION2 BUILD 

* The WebWork2 Incubator code now builds struts-action-2.0-dev.jar

** This JAR can be placed into your sandboxes for runtime testing

* The initial renaming is complete,and the repository seems stable 
enough to make further changes.  

* The WebWork 2 project had a continuous integration server for automated
builds and testing.It would be valuable to have that service, even while 
in the Incubator. 

** What about setting up a temporary build server either in an 
Apache zone or on a developer's computer?

----

CONFLUENCE MIGRATION

What do we need to do to register the Snippet macro the ASF SVN?

* http://forums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?threadID=24290&tstart=0

WebWork2 wiki is now readonly. Volunteers may migrate and add content 
to <http://confluence.twdata.org> at will. Eventually, this content 
may be transferred directly to a ASF server. 

----

JIRA MILESTONES

We prefixING the old releases with WW and startING the new releases
with a numbering scheme only. In this way, old releases will be 
archived properly and we do not lose the history.

----

EARLY RELEASE 

Don and Jason will be hosting a Struts session at JavaOne on May 17. 
It would be helpful if a tagged build of Action2 were available, 
even if Action2 is not out of the incubator yet (though it may be).

Here are some of the things we need to do to create a tagged build:

 1. The tickets gone through, keeping only essential tickets against this next release (2.0.0)
 2. Ensuring the project renaming is complete in a files, including source code comments
 3. Renaming WW instances on the wiki docs (once we get something stood up)
 4. Testing some of the new changes like the date picker, rich text editor, and tooltips

The general release process is described here:

* http://struts.apache.org/releases.html
