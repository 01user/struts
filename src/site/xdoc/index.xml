        Apache Struts 2 is an open source Java web framework that seeks to make
        it easy to build, deploy, and maintain modern web applications. Struts 2
        is the successor to the popular <a href="../1.x/"> Struts 1</a> web
        application framework, as well as a product of a merger between the <a
        href="../">Apache Struts</a> and <a
        href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork">OpenSymphony WebWork</a>
        projects.

        <p>
        How does Struts 2 make web applications easier to develop, deploy, and
        maintain?  Struts 2 provides:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A flexible, plain old Java object (POJO)-based architecture to
          structure your code and pages, yet stay out of your way</li>
          <li>A theme-enabled tag library supporting JSP, Velocity, and
          Freemarker</li>
          <li>Built in support for complex Javascript and Ajax widgets</li>
          <li>A simple plugin framework to integrate with third-party libraries
          like JavaServer Faces, JasperReports, and JFreeChart.</li>
          <li>Built-in debugging tools supporting profiling, problem reports, and
          interactive object model queries.</li>
          <li>Automatic portlet support allowing portal and servlet deployments
          with no code changes</li>
          <li>Quick start development tools like Maven archetypes, automatic
          reloading configuration files, and bootstrap tutorials.</li>
        </ul>

        <section name="Maven Snapshots">
        <p>
            When a distribution is first made available, it is rated as a development build or "snapshot". Later, the quality of the distribution may be upgraded to "Beta" or "General Availability", based on feedback from the community, and then made available through ibiblio and other public Maven repositories. To obtain an early distribution via Maven, you can specify the ASF Snapshot repository in your POM.
