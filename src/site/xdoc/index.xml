            <p>
                Struts Action 2 is a Java web-application development framework.
        It is built specifically with developer productivity and
        code simplicity in mind, providing robust support for building
        reusable UI templates, such as form controls, UI themes,
        internationalization, dynamic form parameter mapping to JavaBeans,
        robust client and server side validation, and much more.
            </p>
